Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name,
AirBedandBreakfast.com.
The company is credited with revolutionizing the tourism industry,
while also having been the subject of intense criticism
by residents of tourism hotspot cities like Barcelona and
Venice for enabling an unaffordable increase in home rents,
and for a lack of regulation.

======================================
Project Description
======================================
This project proposes clonning of AirBnB with aid of
learning real life project using python program for
its console.

==========================================
How to Start
==========================================
To commence the program, a class is defined with several
methods within this frame. a storage class is hence created
hence to save generated object to a json file which at the
moment saves as a data base for collecting values saved as
dictionary.
An id is generated at every instance that is created with a
track (time) documenting when an instance is created and updated

=========================================
How to Use it
=========================================
Just like a typical windows CMD or other terminal, a terminal
(console) is created. this forms an interactive line where the
already created classes and instances can be manipulated. the
cmd raises a prompt of (HBND) while true.

====================================
example
====================================
./console.py  (this executes the python file for the CLI)
the prompt hence is executed expecting a command from user
example
(HBNB) create BaseModel
**the above informs the CLI to create an instance of the BaseModel**
